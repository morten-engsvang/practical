I have set the maximum allowed amount of recursions at 1000
Test 1: f(x) = sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 without Clenshaw-Curtis
The result of test 1: 0.666178
The number of evaluations in test 1: 12016
Test 2: f(x) = 4*sqrt(1-x^2) from 0 to 1 without Clenshaw-Curtis
The result of test 2: 3.14214
The error is: 0.000547943
The number of evaluations in test 2: 273756
Test 3: f(x) = 1/sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 without Clenshaw-Curtis
The result of test 3: 2.00006
The number of evaluations in test 3: 17073792
Test 4: f(x) = 1/sqrt(x) from 0 to 1 with Clenshaw-Curtis
The result of test 4: 1.99969
The number of evaluations in test 4: 130336
Test 5: repeat of test 2 but with Clenshaw-Curtis
The result of test 5: 3.14201
The error is: 0.000414681
The number of evaluations in test 5: 343640
I can calculate the same using the QACS subsroutine from the GSL library
Result, error and number of function evaluations are: 
3.14160223309539
9.57950560120935e-06

-------------------------
A remarkable reduction in evaluations is observed for the integral 1/sqrt(x) from 0 to 1
Using Clenshaw-Curtis to the pi integral gives a small reduction in error,
but also increases the amount of evaluations significantly.
The GSL routine beats me by a long shot both in error and function evaluations
